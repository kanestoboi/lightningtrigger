# Lightning Trigger

Features
* Lightning Triggering - By using a photo transistor, lightning strikes are detected and triggers the camera at the same instant.  
  
* Sound Triggering - Sound triggering mode is used to capture sound events such as water droplets, breaking glass, and fireworks.  
  
* Timelapse- Calculates the number of photos for a given length timelapse, given the photo duration, interval, and total timelapse length before taking all the required photos.  
  
Currently has support for two triggering outputs (can trigger two devices at once) with an additional two outputs being added in the next revision.  
  
Control is through an Android app using the HM-11 Bluetooth module.  
  
Power is from a li-po battery and is charged using an onboard li-po charger.
