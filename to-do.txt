- make footprint for microphone
- edit footprint for 5-way switch to have outline of switch
- move footprints to a global library
- add bluetooth functionality


REV 2 HARDWARE UPDATES
- add bluetooth functionality
- flip LCD header around
- move LCD header down so that cover can close
- get new optoisolator (4 channel)
- get smaller crystal
- change lipo charger to send status to uC (Still need to do uC code)
- add automatic power switching between usb and battery to allow for uC to display battery level when charging 
- add battery level circuitry. Will likely need a voltage reference and voltage divider.
- charger is not working correctly when power switch is off
- add PIR sensor
- need to add logic conversion for HM-11
- need to add voltage conversion for HM-11 input to 3.3V


--------------------------
DONE
--------------------------
- 5 way switch footprint and schematic are incorrect and needs to be re done - Removed 5 way switch as bluetooth will be used in rev 2- remove 5 way switch
- remove 5 way switch
- change resistors and capacitor footprints to be 0603
- Find new parts for 0603 capacitors and resistors
