- make footprint for microphone
- move footprints to a global library
- Create JSON format for information sending from trigger to phone

--------------------------
REV 3 SOFTWARE UPDATES
--------------------------
- change BT status and status LED pins
- timelapse needs to show current progress (progress bar?)
- lightning mode needs total photos that have been captured
- lightning and sound mode need to have a suggested sensitivity
- pause functionality for timelapse 
- single shot mode needs press and hold

--------------------------
REV 3 HARDWARE UPDATES
--------------------------
- remove 16MHz crystal (need to get 8MHz bootloader)
- move output port 1 closer to edge of board
- move SMD components around through hole components the minimum distance for selective solder	(seems to be 4 mm but need to confirm)
- add circuitry to have an output port as an input
- change battery percentage input to be directly from battery terminals
- add Real Time Clock
- fix GNDA and GNDD connection so that they are connected at star ground (make star ground footprint?)
- need to change battery power connector
- add PIR sensor?

--------------------------
DONE FOR REV 3
--------------------------
- Change optocoupler resistors to use lower value
- crystal footprint needs to be fixed
- battery protection is not cutting power at 3V (-BATT and GND on AP211 pins were around the wrong way)
- add npn transistor and resistor to reset pin
- add programming breakout pins for HM-11 to program baud rate, name ect once made
- add ground connection in schematic for USB input ADC
- external interrupt (pin 30) needs to be connected to bluetooth TX (pin 32)
- workout way to update firmware



--------------------------
DONE FOR REV 2
--------------------------
- 5 way switch footprint and schematic are incorrect and needs to be re done - Removed 5 way switch as bluetooth will be used in rev 2- remove 5 way switch
- remove 5 way switch
- change resistors and capacitor footprints to be 0603
- Find new parts for 0603 capacitors and resistors
- get new optoisolator (4 channel)
- add battery level circuitry. Will likely need a voltage reference and voltage divider.
- need to add logic conversion for HM-11
- need to add voltage conversion for HM-11 input to 3.3V
- charger is not working correctly when power switch is off
- add automatic power switching between usb and battery to allow for uC to display battery level when charging 
- change lipo charger to send status to uC (Still need to do uC code)
- flip LCD header around
- move LCD header down so that cover can close
- add bluetooth functionality
- edit footprint for 5-way switch to have outline of switch
- get smaller crystal
- add bluetooth status LED
- add status led
- test if I actually need a variable resistor for sound and light
- change schematic for 2.5mm jacks
- confirm tx/rx lines can be used for software serial
