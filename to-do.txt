- make footprint for microphone
- move footprints to a global library

--------------------------
REV 3 HARDWARE UPDATES
--------------------------
- add ground connection in schematic for USB input ADC
- add Real Time Clock
- fix GNDA and GNDD connection so that they are connected at star ground
- external interrupt (pin 30) needs to be connected to bluetooth TX (pin 32)
- crystal footprint needs to be fixed
- add programming breakout pins for HM-11 to program baud rate, name ect once made
- need to change battery power connector
- add PIR sensor
- workout way to update firmware



--------------------------
DONE
--------------------------
- 5 way switch footprint and schematic are incorrect and needs to be re done - Removed 5 way switch as bluetooth will be used in rev 2- remove 5 way switch
- remove 5 way switch
- change resistors and capacitor footprints to be 0603
- Find new parts for 0603 capacitors and resistors
- get new optoisolator (4 channel)
- add battery level circuitry. Will likely need a voltage reference and voltage divider.
- need to add logic conversion for HM-11
- need to add voltage conversion for HM-11 input to 3.3V
- charger is not working correctly when power switch is off
- add automatic power switching between usb and battery to allow for uC to display battery level when charging 
- change lipo charger to send status to uC (Still need to do uC code)
- flip LCD header around
- move LCD header down so that cover can close
- add bluetooth functionality
- edit footprint for 5-way switch to have outline of switch
- get smaller crystal
- add bluetooth status LED
- add status led
- test if I actually need a variable resistor for sound and light
- change schematic for 2.5mm jacks
- confirm tx/rx lines can be used for software serial
